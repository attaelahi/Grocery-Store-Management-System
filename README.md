## Abstract

This thesis presents POSFlix, a comprehensive web-based Point of Sale (POS) management system designed to address the challenges faced by small to medium-sized retail businesses. The system implements advanced payment handling capabilities including full payment, partial payment, and credit sales management. 

Built using PHP, MySQL, and modern web technologies, POSFlix provides real-time inventory management, comprehensive financial reporting, and role-based user access control. The system's unique partial payment feature allows businesses to offer flexible payment terms to customers while maintaining accurate financial records and payment history tracking.

Key features include:
- Multi-status payment processing (full, partial, unpaid)
- Real-time inventory tracking with automatic stock updates
- Payment history and outstanding payment management
- Invoice generation with automatic printing
- Comprehensive sales and financial reporting
- Role-based access control (Admin/Cashier)
- Complete audit trail for accountability

The system has been tested with various scenarios and demonstrates reliable performance, accurate financial calculations, and user-friendly interface design.

due_amount DECIMAL(10,2)      -- Amount outstanding
payment_status ENUM           -- paid, partial, pending
```

**New Payment History Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_history (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  sale_id INT,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  payment_method VARCHAR(50),
  reference_no VARCHAR(100),
  notes TEXT,
  received_by INT,
  payment_date TIMESTAMP
);
```

## System Architecture

### Three-Tier Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Presentation Layer        │
│   (Browser Interface)       │
└─────────────────────────────┘
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Application Layer         │
│   (PHP Business Logic)      │
└─────────────────────────────┘
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Data Layer                │
│   (MySQL Database)          │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Request Flow

1. User interacts with UI
2. JavaScript validates input
3. AJAX request to PHP controller
4. PHP processes business logic
5. Database transaction executed
6. Response returned as JSON
7. UI updated dynamically

---

## Implementation Highlights

### Partial Payment Processing

#### Client-Side (pos.php)
```javascript
// Payment status selection
handlePaymentStatusChange() {
  if (status === 'partial') {
    showPaidAmountInput();
    validatePartialAmount();
  }
}

// Amount validation
validatePartialAmount() {
  if (amount <= 0 || amount >= total) {
    showError();
    return false;
  }
}
```

#### Server-Side (process_sale.php)
```php
// Calculate payment details
if ($payment_status === 'partial') {
    $paid_amount = floatval($data['paid_amount']);
    $due_amount = $net_amount - $paid_amount;
    
    // Validate
    if ($paid_amount <= 0 || $paid_amount > $net_amount) {
        throw new Exception('Invalid payment amount');
    }
}

// Record in payment history
$stmt->execute([
    $sale_id, 
    $paid_amount, 
    $payment_method, 
    $user_id
]);
```

### Outstanding Payment Collection

**New Module: outstanding_payments.php**
- Lists all partial/unpaid sales
- Shows due amounts
- Provides payment collection interface
- Updates sales and payment history
- Generates receipts

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Payment Status Management
**Problem:** Complex state management for three payment types  
**Solution:** Implemented clear state machine with validation at each step

### Challenge 2: Payment History Tracking
**Problem:** Multiple payments per sale needed tracking  
**Solution:** Created separate payment_history table with foreign key relationships

### Challenge 3: Real-time Stock Updates
**Problem:** Stock must update regardless of payment status  
**Solution:** Stock deducted immediately upon sale creation, payment tracked separately

### Challenge 4: Outstanding Payment Interface
**Problem:** No existing UI for collecting partial payments  
**Solution:** Developed dedicated outstanding_payments.php module with filtering

### Challenge 5: Database Transaction Integrity
**Problem:** Multiple tables need atomic updates  
**Solution:** Implemented database transactions with rollback on failure
